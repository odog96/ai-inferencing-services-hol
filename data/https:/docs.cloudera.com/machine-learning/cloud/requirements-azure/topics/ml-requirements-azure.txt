Azure Account Requirements for Cloudera AI Workbenches
The requirements for using Cloudera AI Workbenches in Azure are described in Working with Azure
 environments, which is linked in the Related information section, below.
In addition, Cloudera AI on Azure has a few additional requirements: 
Cloudera AI requires one Azure virtual network.
Each Cloudera AI Workbench requires its own subnet.
Each Cloudera AI Workbench requires its own NFS file share.
Azure Files NFS 4.1, or Azure NetApp Files, are the recommended services, in order of
 preference. For Azure Files NFS 4.1, only NFS version 4.1 is supported. For Azure NetApp
 Files, only NFS version 3 is supported. We require the No Root Squash (or Allow Root
 Access) export option, and the volume must be shared with read and write access. The NFS
 volume must be created with at least 100 GB of storage capacity to ensure adequate I/O
 performance. It is also possible, although not recommended, to use an external NFS. For
 more information, see Other NFS Options in Related information.
