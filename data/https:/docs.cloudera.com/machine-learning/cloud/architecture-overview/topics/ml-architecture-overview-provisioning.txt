Provisioning
Cloudera AI utilizes the Cloudera Data Platform Control Plane to manage Data Services so you can provision and
delete Cloudera AI Workbench. Cloudera Data Platform Control Plane leverages cloud native capabilities to dynamically
access CPU, memory, and GPU resources along with cloud-managed Kubernetes (K8s) to provide the
infrastructure. 
During provisioning the Cloudera AI application is configured to authenticate end
users of the service (Cloudera AI) via the Cloudera Data Platform identity provider, which is chained back to the
customers identity provider. As a result, Cloudera AI provisioned instances allow for
seamless customer SSO. 
When you provision a Cloudera AI Workbench, the following happens:

Cloudera Data Platform Control Plane performs the following in the cloud environment: 
Requests a TLS Certificate and domain name with the cloudera.site domain
Identifies the SSO configuration
Identifies the SDX configuration for the environment 

 Cloudera Data Platform Control Plane provisions a managed Kubernetes cluster 
Cloudera Data Platform Control Plane installs Cloudera AI into the Kubernetes environment 
Storage is mounted directly via managed service providers 

Cloudera AI uses the cloud provider load balancer and networking infrastructure to partition the
resources. Cloudera AI also leverages the cloud provider infrastructure to enable the customer to
specify autoscaling. 
Cloudera AI provisions the DNS and the certificate. Cloudera AI renews the certificates for the customer on
an ongoing basis.
