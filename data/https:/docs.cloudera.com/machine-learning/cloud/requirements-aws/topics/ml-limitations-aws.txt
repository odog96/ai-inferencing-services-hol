Limitations on AWS
This section lists some resource limits that Cloudera AI and AWS impose
 on workloads running in Cloudera AI Workbenches. 


Certificate creation (for TLS) uses LetsEncrypt which is limited to 2000
certs/week. As such a single tenant in Cloudera Data Platform can create a maximum of 2000 Cloudera AI Workbenches
per week.


Cloudera AI imposes a limit (50) on the number of pods a user can create at
any point within a specific Cloudera AI Workbench. This limit is not
configurable. 


Cloudera AI allows you to provision a maximum of 100 compute nodes per Cloudera AI Workbench. This does
not include any additional infrastructure nodes Cloudera AI might need to provision to run the
 service. 


Amazon EKS imposes a limit on the number of pods you can run
simultaneously on a node. This limit varies depending on your
instance type. For details, see ENI Max Pods.

Cloudera AI creates one Amazon Elastic File System per Cloudera AI Workbench. The number of Elastic File
 Systems in a region is limited to 1000 per account. Therefore, the number of Cloudera AI Workbenches
  in a region is limited to 1000 at any given time for a given account.
